To support an analytics team interested in the relationship between bike ridership and weather, several views were created in PostgreSQL. These views include aggregations of bike ride data by day, hour, and weather conditions, allowing analysts to explore patterns such as how weather (e.g., temperature and precipitation) affects ride durations and frequency. Key views include total rides per day, average ride duration by weather, hourly bike usage by weather, busiest stations, and identification of suspicious ride durations. These views help simplify complex queries, making data more accessible while highlighting potential data quality issues, such as negative ride durations, that may require further investigation.
